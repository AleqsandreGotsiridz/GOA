<h2 style="text-align: center;">DRIFT CAR</h2>
<p>The S10 was the first mass-produced Silvia built on the all-new S platform, intended as Nissan's compact, rear-wheel-drive, sporty car platform.[7] Japanese versions were exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called Nissan Prince Store along with the larger C110 Skyline. The S10 featured less "traditional" lines than similar offerings from rivals Toyota and Mazda sharing a common appearance with the larger Skyline. Initially, the S10 was intended to be powered by a rotary engine, however this idea was scrapped due to the oil crises of the 1970s.[8] The S10 was based on the Datsun Sunny Coupe.Japan
In Japan, the S10, officially named "New Silvia" was initially fitted with a 1.8 L L18S straight-four engine, which it shared with the Datsun 610/Bluebird 180B. The Japanese version featured Nissan NAPS emission control technology at its introduction. In 1976, the S10 received its first upgrade which included a new trim level "Type-LSE" which got a new L18E engine which had an electronic fuel injection intake instead of the carburetor. This upgrade also included a change to the model name, from S10 to S11. In 1977, the S11 received upgrades including interior upgrades, a body-colored front grille, new wheels, new hubcaps, new rubber bumper corners, a new trim level "Type-G" and more optional parts and colors.[9]</p>
